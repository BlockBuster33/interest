<h1> The Easiest Role in the Game </h1>
<p> It is not lie that support is the easiest role. You simply need to know when to go in or who to heal. Other than that, the hardest part of playing support is having an absolutly idiotic ADC, which is common but if you are good enough that does not matter. As support, you want to make sure your ADC gets fed or at least the enemy ADC is not fed. You either provide set up for the ADC to get kills or heal them and help them attack the enemy. </p>

<h2> The Champs of Support </h2>
<p> Now, in comparison to support, there are not as many champs as top lane. However, there are still only a few support champs that are actually worth playing/maining. </p>
<table border="0" id="top_table">
 <tr>
  <td>
    <b> Leona </b>
    </br>
    </br>
    Leona is consistently the strongest support champ in the game. She is simple yet extremely powerful, especially in the right hands.
    </br>
    </br>
    Abilities: Her passive is that enemies attacked by Leona are afflicted with Sunlight and when allies attack marked enemies, they deal bonus magic damage. Her Q simply empower to next auto attack to stun an enemy for 1 second. Her W grants Leona a shield for 3 seconds that increases her armor and magic resis; after 3 seconds, the shield explodes and deals magic damage to nearby enemies. Leona's E is her throwing her sword forward and, if it connects with any enemy champion, the enemy is rooted and Leona dashes to them. Her R basically throws down the power of the Sun in a circle and any enemy caught in the center are stunned.
    </br>
    </br>
    Items: Start with Relic Shield and two health potions. Your full build is Mobility Boots, Locket of Iron Solari (provides allies within an area with shields), Zeke's Convergance, and Knight's Vow. You can also build Thornmail, but most of the time you will only build 2-3 items because supports do not get that much gold.
    </br>
    </br>
    Runes: Glacial Augment, Hex Flash, Biscuits, Cosmic Insights. Secondary, take bone plating and unflinching. Then, take Ability Haste and 2x armor. You can also take Aftershock, but Glacial is really good for locking enemies (especially immobile) ADCs down.

 <tr>
   <td>
     <b> Lux </b>
     </br>
     </br>
     Again, like Leona, simple champ, but does a lot. Unlike Leona, Lux can also deal a ton of damage.
     </br>
     </br>
     Abilities: Her passive is that enemies hit by her abilities are marked and if she auto-attacks them, she deals bonus magic damage. Her Q, Lux throws out a bind that roots enemies for 2 seconds and can bind two enemies/minions/jungle champs at the same time. Her W is basically Lux throwing her staff in a straight line to shield herself and any allies within the line. Her E sets an circular area that slows enemies and can be recast to explode and deal magic damage. With Lux's R, she releases a large beam of magic energy stuff that can hurt...a lot.
     </br>
     </br>
     Items: Start with Spellthief's Edge and two health pots. Your full build is Sorcerer's Shoes, Luden's Tempest, Zhonya's Hourglass, and Morellonomicon. You can also go Crown of the Shattered Queen instead of Luden's if the enemies have a lot of assassins/burst champions.
     </br>
     </br>
     Runes: Take Comet, Manaflow Band, Transcendence, and Scorch. Secondary, take biscuits and cosmic insights. Finally, take 2x adaptive force and armor.
   </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
   <td>
     <b> Nautilus </b>
     </br>
     </br>
     This sea-dwelling support is actually pretty awesome character throughout the entire game. He functions very similar to Leona, with some key differences.
     </br>
     </br>
     Abilities: His passive is that, if he auto-attacks an enemy, he roots them for 1.5 seconds. His Q throws how his hook, dragging him and the opponent together. His W gives him a shield for 2 seconds and increases his magic damage. His E sends out three exploding shockwaves around him, slowing enemies. His R is a point-and-click knock up, with Nautilus clicking on an enemy and firing a shockwave to them that knocks and stuns the enemy, as well as knocking anyone caught in a straight line between the enemy and Naut.
     </br>
     </br>
     Items: Start with Relic Shield and two health pots. Then, like Leona, your full build is mobility boots, Locket of Iron Solari, Zeke's Convergance, and Knight's Vow.
     </br>
     </br>
     Runes: Glacial, Perfect Timing (gives you a free spotwatch), Biscuits, and Cosmic Insights. Secondary, take Shield Bash and Bone Plating. Then, take ability haste, armor, and health.
   </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
   <td>
     <b> Rakan (guy on the left) </b>
     </br>
     </br>
     He is a pretty funny character, meant to duo with Xayah, an ADC and his wife (lorewise). He provides very good engage and shields, but is also very squishy.
     </br>
     </br>
     Abilities: Periodically, Rakan gains a shield. His Q launches a magical feather that deals magic damage and, if it hits an opponent, it restores Rakan's and nearby allies' health after 3 seconds. Rakan's W is his main engage tool, where he dashes to a location, knocking up nearby enemies. Rakan's E is his mainly shielding and escape tool, as his E let's him dash to nearby allies granting a shield for 3 seconds. His R is also his main engage tool; Rakan gains 75% movement speed for 4 seconds and, if he runs into enemies, Rakan charms them for 1-1.5 seconds.
     </br>
     </br>
     Items: Relic Shield and two health pot start. Then you build Lucidity boots, Shureyla's Battlesong (gives AOE move speed buff to allies), Chemtech Purifier (reduces healing on enemies), and Redemption (can be cast in an area to provide healing and deal true damage to enemies).
     </br>
     </br>
     Runes: Guardian, Font of Life, Bone Plating, and unflinching. Secondary, take Zombie Ward and Ultimate Hunter. Then, take 2x adaptive force and armor.
   </td>

 <tr>
   <td>
     <b> Karma </b>
     </br>
     </br>
     Her in-character design is kinda meh, but her lore is interesting.
     </br>
     </br>
     Abilities: After 5 spells or autoattacks, Karma's next attack is empowered. An important part of her kit is her R, which empowers her Q, W, and E. Her Q-regular is just Karma firing a blast of energy that explodes when hitting an enemy; her Q-ult is Karma firing a blast of energy that creates a cataclysm in the ground that slows enemies and explodes after a few seconds. Her W-regular is a tether to a champion and if the champion doesn't break thr tether after 2 seconds, they are rooted for 1.4-2 seconds; her W-ult is like that but also provides insane healing to Karma. Her E-regular provides a shield for 2.5 seconds and 40% move speed for 1.5 seconds to Karma or allies; her E-ult does the same but also speeds up any allies within the area that Karma casted it.
     </br>
     </br>
     Items: Spelltheif's Edge and two health pots. Your full build is Lucidity boots, Shureyla's Battlesong, Chemtech Purifier, and Staff of Flowing Water.

 <tr>
   <td>
     <b> Thresh </b>
     </br>
     </br>
     This is one of the best character designs in the game. He is one of the hardest champs to master, simply because of his Q, a extremely hard to land skillshot.
     </br>
     </br>
     Abilities: If minions/enemies/jungle champs die near him, Thresh harvest their soul, increasing his armor and ability power. As mentioned before, his Q is a skill shot where Thresh throws his scythe stunning enemies for 1.5 seconds and pulling them in to him; this can be recast so Thresh is dragged to them. His W is a lantern that Thresh throws on the ground, giving him and his allies healing; allies can click on the lantern to dash straight to Thresh. Thresh's E pulls/pushes enemies, depending on the direction of his E, and slows enemies for 1 by 20-40%. Thresh's R creates a pentagon prison around him and if any enemies cross the walls of it, then they are slowed by 99% for 2 seconds.
     </br>
     </br>
     Items: Steel Shouldergards and 2 health pots. Your full build is mobility boots, Locket of Iron Solari, Zeke's Converage, and Knight's Vow.
     </br>
     </br>
     Runes: Glacial Augment, Hexflash, Biscuits, and Time Warp Tonic. Secondary, take Bone Plating and Unflinching. Then, take 2x adaptive force and armor.

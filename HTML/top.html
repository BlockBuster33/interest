<h1> The Middle Child of Lanes </h1>
<p> Often times, you will hear top laners complain about how no one careas about top lane - and they are not wrong. For the most part, top lane is a 1v1 lane where it is you and the opposing top laner farming and battling out. You win top lane either through pure 1v1 skill or amazing wave management. Let's get into it. Your main role as a top laner it really to try to take turrents down, take out the backline, or be the frontline/damage eater for your team. </p>

<h2> The Champs of Top Lane </h2>
<p> Typically, the champs of toplane are tanky-bruisers that eat damage and/or deal damage. Typically, top laners will take either conqueror or grasp. There exceptions to this: Jayce will sometimes take First Strike and other ranged top laners (Lucian, Teemo, Quinn) will take PTA. Here are some of the most popular top-lane champs, in order of difficulty, that are worthwhile to actually learn or main.</p>
<table border="0" id="top_table">
 <tr>
  <td>
   <b style="font-size:24px;"> Garen </b>
   </br>
   </br>
   This is probably the best top laner to start on. He is a good mix of tanky and heavy damage.
  </br>
  </br>
   Abilities: His passive is basically increased healing after not taking damage for some period of time. His Q sets his next auto attack to silence opponents (bascially they cannot cast spells for a second or so). His W is a shield that negates a good amount of damage. His E aka the BeyBlade spell, has him spinning in a circle 8 times, dealing increased damage per spin. This is really good for wave clear and when you are on top of an opponent. Now, his ultimate, is strikes the enemy down with "the might of Demaica" (League's words not mine). Make sure to time this ult correctly when the enemy is low HP in order to kill them off.
   </br>
   </br>
    Runes: Take conqueror, with Triumph, Legend: Tenacity, Last Stand, for primary. Then, for secondary runes, take Nimbus Cloak and Trancendance. Finally, 2 adapative force and armor.
    </br>
    </br>
    Items: Start the game with Doran's Shield and a health pot. Then, your full build with be Stridebreaker, Mortal Reminder, Deadman's Plate, Berserker's Greaves, Death Dance, and Spirit Visage (for increased healing).
  </br>
  </br>
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
   <td>
   <b style="font-size:24px;"> Darius </b>
   </br>
   </br>
   Again, this is another good top laner to start on. Similar to Garen, his kit is pretty simple.
   </br>
   </br>
   Abilities: His passive is basically, if he auto attacks an enemy or hits an enemy with any of his abilities, they will bleed, slowly losing health for a few seconds, with a max of 5 bleed stacks. His Q basically has Darius spiining his axe in a circle and Darius with regain some health if he hits enemies or minions with this. His W empowers his next autoattack to slow the enemy for two seconds. His E will pull in any enemy, minion, or jungle champ within a few hundred units in front of him. His R is basically him jumping up and hitting the enemy on the head with his axe. This is best to do when the enemy have 5 bleed stacks and is low hp.
   </br>
   </br>
   Runes: Take conqueror, Triumph, Legend: Tenacity, and Last Stand. For secondary, this will depend on your matchup. Against melees, take bone plating and overgrowth; against ranged, take second wind and overgrowth. Then, take 2x adaptive force and armor.
   </br>
   </br>
   Items: Start the game with Doran's shield and a health pot. Then, your full build will be Trinity Force, Death Dance, Plated Steelcaps/Mercury Treads, Maw of Malmortius (if AP/magic champs on enemy team), Sterak's Gage, and Deadman's.
  </br>
  </br>

 <tr>
  <td>
    <b style="font-size:24px;"> Jax </b>
    </br>
    </br>
    Want a champ that has probably the best lines and jumps around? Jax is one for you.
    </br>
    </br>
    Abilities: His passive is basically the more attacks you do, your attack speed increases. His Q is a point and click leap to enemies, allies, and even ward. His W empowers his next autoattack or Q. His E is the strongest ability in his kit; He enters a defensive stance that blocks any attacks for 2 seconds and stuns enemies within a short radius for 1 second. His R grants Jax armor and magic resist for a few seconds and makes every third attack deal extra magic damage.
    </br>
    </br>
    Runes: Take Lethal Tempo, Triumph, Legend: Alacrity, and Last Stand. For secondary, take biscuits and time warp tonic. Then, take attack speed, adaptive force, and armor.
    </br>
    </br>
    Items: Start with corrupting pot (regens your health and mana), then take Blade of the Ruined King, Plated Steelcaps/Mercury Treads, Trinity Force, Death Dance, Maw of Malmortius, and Sterak's Gage.
    </br>

  <td>
    <b style="font-size:24px"> Sett </b>
    </br>
    </br>
    Now, we are starting to ramp up the difficulty of our champs. Sett isn't the most complex champ, but he certainly takes some practice.
    </br>
    </br>
    Abilities: His passive is basically that he alternates between his right and left punches, with his right punches being faster. Also, the more health he loses, the faster his health regen is. His Q increases his movement speed and empowers his next two autoattacks. Now for the W, as Sett takes more damage, he stores some of that as Grit. His W releases that Grit in a cone dealing strong true damage and granting him a shield for 3 seconds. His E is that be pulls enemies on both sides of him and if there are enemies on both sides, the enemies are stunned for 2 seconds. Finally, Sett's Ult has him grab the enemy, flip them in the air, and slam them into the ground.
    </br>
    </br>
    Runes: Take Conqueror, Legend: Tenacity, and Last Stand. For secondary, take bone plating for melee or second wind for ranged, and then unflinching. Then, like Jax, take attack speed, adaptive force, and armor.
    </br>
    </br>
    Items: Start with either Doran's Blade or Shield with a health pot. Your full build will be Hullbreaker, Plated Steelcaps/Mercury Treads, Stridebreaker, Titantic Hydra, Death Dance, and Sterak's Gage.

    <b> Aatrox </b>
    </br>
    </br>
    Right now, he is pretty broken as hell because of how much healing is in the game.
    </br>
    </br>
    Abilities: His passive is that, periodically, Aatrox's next auto attack is empowered and he gains +50 range and deals 5-12% of target's max health, also healing Aatrox for 100% of post-attack damage. Aatrox's Q is something he can cast three times, with his massive sword swinging in front of him, with a sweet spot that deals the most damage and heals him. His W is hime shooting out like a chain; if it hits an enemy, then they have to escape a box area in 1.5 or be pulled back. His E is basically a dash he can use to get over walls, get closer to opponents, or run away. His ult is actually pretty badass. He becomes thing flying winged devil, which grants him bonus move speed, 20-40% bonus AD, and 30-60% bonus healing.
    </br>
    </br>
    Items: Start out with Doran's Shield and health pot. Then, your full build with be Plated Steelcaps/Mercury Treads, Goredrinker, Death Dance, Sterak's Gage, Maw of Malmortius, and Black Cleaver/Bramble Vest.
    </br>
    </br>
    Runes: Take Conqueror, Triumph, Legend: Tenacity, and Last Stand. For secondary, take bone plating/second wind and revitalize. Then, take 2x adaptive force and armor.

     <b> Ornn </b>
     </br>
     </br>
     Now, this absolute gigachad of a champion is Ornn. Honestly, he is my favorite champ and right now, he is super strong in the meta. If you want a tank that can deal damage and play for his team, this is your man.
    </br>
    </br>
    Abilites: His passive is (i) he can craft non-consumable anywhere and (ii) after level 14, he can upgrade ally items and that gives him 4% armor, health, and magic resists. His Q is basically him slamming the ground, causing a fissure that slows any enemies or minions in the way as well as setting up a little pillar/mountain. His W is literally him breathing fire. Any enemy that gets hit by this has "Brittle" applied to them, which means that the next auto-attack Ornn does to them deals extra damage and knocks them up as he claps their head. His E is him ramming forward. This can also knock up enemies if he rams into a wall or his Q-pillar and enemies are nearby. With his R, Ornn calls forth a large stampeading lava elemental that runs towards him, applying brittle to enemies in the path, and Ornn can redirect the elemental to hit enemies and knock them up.
    </br>
    </br>
    Items: Start out with Doran's Shield and health pot. In lane, make sure to buy Tear of the Mana Goddess because Ornn is pretty mana hungry. Your full build is Plated Steelcaps/Mercury Treads, Frostfire Gauntlet, Winter's Approach, Thornmail, Randuin's Omen, and Warmog's Armor.
    </br>
    </br>
    Runes: Grasp, Demolish, Bone Plating, Overgrowth. Secondary, Biscuits and Cosmis Insight. Then, Ability Haste (spell cooldown)/attack speed, and 2x armor.

 <tr>
   <td>
     <b> Jayce </b>
    </br>
    </br>
    Now we are starting to enter the realm of complex top lane champs. Jayce is interesting in that he has two forms, hammer form and cannon form.
    </br>
    Hammer form: Jayce is melee. His Q has him flip and leap to opponents, slamming the ground. His W creates an eletrical field around him. His E, he can knock back opponents. His R switches to his cannon form.
    </br>
    Cannon form: Jayce is ranged. His Q send out like a orb of electricity. His W increases his next three auto attacks. His E creates an aceeleration gate the speeds up Jayce and allies that walk through it. Additionally, if Jayce shoots his Q through the gate, it creates an empowered shockblast that extra A LOT of damage.
    </br>
    </br>
    Items: Start with long sword and refillable potion. Your full build is Lucidity Boots (for cooldown), Eclipse, Manamune, Serylda's Grudge, Youmuu's Ghostblade/Edge of Night, Edge of Night/Serpent's Fang/Maw of Malmortius.

    </br>
    Runes: Conqueror, Presence of Mind (for mana), Legend: Alacrity, and Last Stand. Secondary, Boots and Biscuits. Then, take 2x adaptive force and armor. You coud also do First Strike, but right now in the meta, Conq is better.

     <b> Riven </b>
     </br>
     </br>
     Abilities: Her passive is basically the more auto attacks or spells she casts, the more AD she gains. Her Q is her lashing three strikes, with the last strike slamming the ground with her sword and knocking any enemy within a small area. Her W is a stun that stuns any enemy for 0.75 seconds within a 300 radius circle. Her E is basically a dash, like Aatrox, that grants her a shield for 1.5 seconds. Finally, her R transforms her broken sword into a complete one, granting increased damage, range, and she can recast her R to send a wave of energy.
     </br>

     <b> Irelia </b>
     </br>
     </br>
     This champ is honestly disgustingly strong, but she does require good coordination.
     </br>
     </br>
     Abilities: Her passive is basically, for each spell she casts, she gains a stack with a max of four stacks, increasing her damage, attack speed, and lifesteal. Her Q is a point and click dash she can use to dash to enemies or minions. The cooldown for this is refreshed if her Q kills the target. Her W is Irelia entering a defensive stance, with her taking less damage and AP; then Irelia lashes out her blades, dealing physical damage. With her E, Irelia throws one blade into the ground and recasts it to through another blade. When both blades are in the ground, any enemy in a straight line between the blades are stunned; if Irelia Q's them, her Q cooldown is refunded. Finally, Irelia's R throws out a barrage of blades, causing any enemy that walks through them to be slowed and, if she Q's them, her Q cooldown is refunded.
     </br>
     </br>

     <b> Camille aka Bane of Top Lane </b>
     </br>
     </br>
     Similar to Irelia, Camille is disgustinly broken right now but also requires really good coordination.
     </br>
     </br>
     Abilities: Her passive is that auto attacking an enemy grants Camille a shield based on the enemy's main damage type. Her Q, disgustingly broken ability, is two parts: (i) her next auto attack is empowered and (ii) Camille can recast this and her next auto attack will deal true damage and grant her movement speed. Her W is Camille leaping and slicing the air with her scissor leg, and any enemy hit by this are slowed and Camille regains some health. With her E (a skillshot), Camille can attach to a nearby wall and recast it to leap in any direction from the wall. If Camille leaps to an enemy, she stuns them and gets additional attack speed.

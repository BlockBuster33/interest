<h1> Runes </h1>
<p> Runes are one of the most complex things in League. These are enhancements to champions that you select. They determine how much damage you deal, your durability in fights, and your build path; runes make or break your game. </p>
</br>

<h2 style="color:#feb281;text-align:center;"> Precision </h2>
<div id="precision">
  <div class="precision_runes"> <b> Conqueror </b>: This is the most common rune within the Precision tree, typically used by brusier fighters that need to survive for long fights. This rune is fairly simple: attack enemy champ, deal more damage. Every time you attack an enemy champion you get 2-5 stacks of adaptive force, with the max amount of stacks being 12. Once you each full stacks, you not only deal more damage but you also get bonus healthing (9% return in health for melee champs & 6% for ranged champs).
  </div>
  <div class="precision_runes">
    <b> Leathal Tempo </b>: Similar to conqueror, this rune is simple: attack the enemy, your attack speed and range increases. This rune is typically used by ADCs who require faster auto attacks and larger range to poke out enemies. However, this rune can also be used by melee champs (primarily Yone and Yasuo aka the Weeb-Cringe Wind Brothers) who, like ADCs, are more auto-attack focused and deal a lot damage through auto-attacks.
  </div>
  <div class="precision_runes">
    <b> Press the Attack (PTA) </b>: Attack the enemy three times within a few seconds, your subequent auto-attacks deal more damage. Similar to lethal tempo, this is most common on ADCs as they are more auto-attack based. However, there are certain melee champs (Volibear, Pantheon) that this is viable on. Most of the time, especially with Lethal Tempo, you will be taking PTA, if it is viable on your champ, when you want to deal some quick damage.
  </div>
  <div class="precision_runes">
    <b> Fleet Footwork </b>: This rune is kind of trash, not gonna lie. The more you move around, the more you build up these <i> Energize </i> stacks, with a max stacks of 100. When you have 100 stacks, your next auto-attack heals you and gives you 20% movement speed for 1 second. This rune is viable on some champs (Graves, Caitlyn, Nasus, Bard). However, this rune is not really used often, especially as there is already a lot of healing and movement speed in the game.
  </div>
</div>

<h2 style="color:#b71a23;text-align:center;font-size:24px"> Domination </h2>
<div id="dom">
  <div class="dom_runes"> <b> Electrocute </b>: Attack an enemy three times in a row, a bolt of lightning will strike them down and deal extra damage to them. This is really good for assassins, characters that focus on quick 1v1s that you can't react to. Against tanks, this does not do a lot. However, against squishy characters (i.e., ADCs), this will destroy them to kingdom come.
  </div>
  <div class="dom_runes"> <b> Predator </b>: When you get boots, you can activate them and run towards enemies, within a 3,0000-unit range, faster for 10 seconds. After ramping you, your next auto attack will deal 40-120, depending on your level. This is typically used by champs like Galio, Twisted Fate, and Gragas (jungle).
  </div>
  <div class="dom_runes"> <b> Dark Harvest </b>: When an enemy is low health (50% of their max health) and you hit them, you gain a dark harvest stack. You deal 20-60 and, per stack, gain +25% bonus AD and +15% bonus AP. This is used by champs like Nidalee, Ekko, and Jhin.
  </div>
  <div class="dom_runes"> <b> Hail of Blades </b>: Starting and completing an attack against an enemy gives you 2 stacks of Hail of Blades, increasing your auto attacks for 3 seconds. This refreshes when you start attack new champions. This rune is mainly used on Kai'sa.
  </div>
</div>

<h2 style="color:#72c8f4;text-align:center;font-size:24px"> Sorcery </h2>
<div id="sorcery">
  <div class="sorcery_runes"> <b> Comet </b>: Hitting a champion with an ability lauches a "comet" at their location. If the enemy is hit by the comet, it deals 30-100 damage to them. You use this mainly of mages, like Lux and Karma. However, you can also use this on Miss Fortune.
  </div>
  <div class="sorcery_runes"> <b> Phase Rush </b>: Attacking (either spells or auto attacks) gives you a stack of Phase Rush. Get three stacks on a champ and your movement speed increases for 4 seconds and you get a slow resist for 3 seconds. This is mainly on mages, like Syndra, Viktor, and Ryze who all need mobility to escape enemies.
  </div>
  <div class="sorcery_runes"> <b> Aery </b>: Dealing auto attacks or spells against enemies signal "Aery" to pounce on them for 0.45 seconds dealing 10-40 damage. If you are a healing champ, Aery can also jump on an ally champ and give them shielding for 0.35 seconds shielding them for 30-80 damage. This is use on mages (Viktor, Ryze, Oriana, Syndra) and enchanters (Lulu, Karma, Nami).
  </div>
</div>

<h2 style="color:#2df892;text-align:center;font-size:24px"> Resolve </h2>
<div id="resolve">
  <div class="resolve_runes"> <b> Aftershock </b>: Immboilizing (CC'ing) an enemy champ grants you 35 +80% bonus armor and magic resist for 2.5 seconds. After the 2.5 seconds, you release a shockwave that deals 25-120 magic damage to nearby enemies. This is used mainly by tanky supports, like Thresh, Leona, Alistar, Gragas, Nautilus, and Blitzcrank.
  </div>
  <div class="resolve_runes"> <b> Grasp </b>: When you start attacking a champ, you gain 1 stack that last 3 seconds. Continue attacking, you gain additional stacks for 2 seconds. Once you have 4 total stacks, you can auto-attack the enemy and get a grasp proc, which deals 2.4%-4% damage (based on your max health), heals you for 1.2%-2% of your max health, and permantly grants you 3-5 bonus health. You tank this mainly on tanky champs that need health, like Ornn, Camille, or Sion. This is also taken by Gangplank.
  </div>
  <div class="resolve_runes"> <b> Gaurdian </b>: If you are within 350 units of an ally, you raise a "guard", which provies the ally with a shield for 2 seconds if you or the ally take 90-250 damage. This is taken by engage-healing champs, so Rakan, Thresh, and Taric often use this rune.
  </div>
</div>

<h2 style="color:#6abdc8;text-align:center;font-size:24px"> Inspiration </h2>
<div id="inspiration">
  <div class="inspiration_runes"> <b> First Strike </b>: Being the first to attack an enemy grants you 5 gold and results in you dealing 10% bonus true damage for 3 seconds after your first attack. This does have a pretty long cooldown (25-15 seconds per level). The rune is mainly used by champs that are very gold reliant and efficient, namely Jayce, Viktor, or Gangplank.
  </div>
  <div class="inspiration_runes"> <b> Unsealed Spellbook </b>: After the first 6 minutes of the game, you can swap one of your summenor spells for another one and use it within a 25 second time window. You can only swap spells if you are not teleporting (using the Teleport summenor spell) or are out-of-combat for 5 seconds. The more times you swap spells, the more your cooldown to swap spells decreases. This is used mainly by Twisted Fate when against other mages or tanks when against ranged top laners.
  </div>
  <div class="inspiration_runes"> <b> Glacial Augment </b>: CC'ing an enemy champion shoots out 3 glacial rays from them towards you and other close enemies. This increase ice zones for 3 seconds that slow down enemies by 30%. This is also used by supports, mainly engage supports like Leona, Nautilus, Thresh, and Blitz.
